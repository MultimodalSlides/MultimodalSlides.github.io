For my website, I used ElevenLabs to clone my voice. Multimodal Slides can use ElevenLabs to convert the transcript into an audio file along with making sure that the various animations are triggered at the right moment.

This application will simply put the results into a folder on your computer or Local Area Network.</span>

Once the Multimodal Slides server conversion process is complete, a download link will become available to get the results in a .zip file.</span>

The Multimodal Slides server process can auto-detect a file change, or get manually triggered, to process the PowerPoint file. The results will be placed in a new folder within your file sharing service.</span>

Like the third option, the Multimodal Slides server process can auto-detect a file change within the file repository or get manually triggered to process the PowerPoint file.

There are pros and cons to each of these ways to convert your PowerPoint file. You will need to choose what is best for you and your workflow.</span>

You could be using WordPress, Umbraco, Orchard, or one of the many other options. You may have a custom web site that makes it even easier to integrate. You could also host a free website on GitHub Pages and make it a stand-alone website.</span>

                    <br />

The Multimodal web page can be published and shared in a manner that best suits your needs and those of your organization.</span>
